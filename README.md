Hello! Here is a Discord Bot used for bounty hunting! 

With this bot you can: 
    - add bounties
    - remove bounties
    - add xp
    - have a xp level system
    - have a log of all messages sent in the server
    - and more!

Before you clone all the files and run the bot, you need to fill in some important details in the 'bountyBot.py' file in order for the bot to work.
      First you have to fill in the necessary channel IDs.
      Then you have to fill in the ID for your bounty hunter role.
      Next you have to add the @ mention for your bounty hunter role.
      And the final step *should* be to add your bot token in order for the program to run.

Feel free to edit the code to your needs etc, and if any issues occur, send them in the 'Issues' tab!
-Thank you
